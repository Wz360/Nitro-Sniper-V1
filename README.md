What does this Nitro Sniper do?
The Discord Nitro Stealer (Nitro Sniper) Is our newest application yet! It works like a charm and we have a ton of supporters!

How does it grab the nitro?
It's very easy to explain. Discord has an interesting set of files in it's app data, and these type of files, can
be dangerous in someones hand. For example, if you look at the discord cache using specific apps, you can look at
a EXTREME version of the discord audit log (Logs). In short, you can look at everyones past messages, and deleted messages.
It also updates in real time. So, what does the bot do? It looks for all nitro gift links in real time, and steals them and
auto puts them in your nitro gift section.

Is it a virus? No! We made the code open sourced, so you can take a look and read the code yourself.
